# Predicting House Prices




In this notebook I went over the Ames Housing Dataset and attempted to create a linear regression model that is able to predict the price of a house with a 
7.85% error.

I later used this notebook for my submission in [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and was able to score in the top 16.8% of participants.

**This project:** 

- Definitely ranked up my feature engineering skills and showed me the important of domain knowledge for building machine learning models
- Helped me raise my expertise with model selection and particularily the benefits of using GridSearchCV
- Gave me an understanding of what it is like to go from a raw dataset that needs to be heavily processed and manipulated to a ready to deploy model
