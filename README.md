# Linear-Regression-Project




In this notebook I went over the  Ames Housing Dataset and attempted to create a linear regression model that is able to predict the price of a house within a 
10% error. (I was able to get 7.85% error!)




This project: 

- Definitely ranked up my feature engineering skills and showed me the important of domain knowledge in data science
- Helped me familiarize myself with the sklean library and particularily the benefits of using GridSearchCV instead of either RidgeCV or LassoCV (I don't think I will ever use them individually again)
- Gave me an understanding of what it is like to go from a raw dataset that needs to be heavily processed and manipulated to a ready to deploy model
